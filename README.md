# KiCad Library

This library contains a number of KiCad symbols and footprints that I have created for use in my designs.

## Symbols

`Conn_02x30_Counter_Clockwise_No47`: Adapted from KiCad defaults.

## Footprints

`CardEdge_EDAC_3x5-060_2x30_P2.54mm_CCW_No47.kicad_mod`: Adapted from KiCad defaults.
`USB_A_Stewart_SS-52100-001_Horizontal.kicad_mod`: Copied from KiCad defaults; attached working 3D model.

## 3D Models

`395-060-558-201 - EDAC Card Edge Connector.STEP`: Downloaded from EDAC website.
`67643-0910.stp`: I think downloaded from Molex, but applied to the Stewart footprint because it seems to be very similar.
